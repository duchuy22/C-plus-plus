//#2 Lottery Winners

/*
A lottery ticket buyer purchases 10 tickets a week, always playing the same 10 5-digit "lucky" combinations
Write a program that initializes an array or a vector with these numbers and then lets the player enter this
week's winning 5-digit number. The program should perform a linear search through the list of the player's
numbers and report whether or not one of the tickets is a winner this week. Here are the numbers.
 
13579   26791   26792   33445   55555   62483   77777   79422   85647   93121
